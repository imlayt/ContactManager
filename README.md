# ContactManager
A lightweight contact manager with Sqlite3 storage and PySimpleGUI front end.

This application is a learning project focused on three things:
  1. Python programming in general
  2. interface development using PySimpleGUI
  3. application data storage using Sqlite3

The app itself is intended to be a usable contact manager. As I said, it is a learning exercise so the code is pretty far from PEP-8. ;-)
